# ProtrusionModel
A MATLAB model of actin filaments and adhesions interacting with a cell membrane to create a protrusion.


Open and run "SimulateLamellipodiumModel_KRC01_NonFunction.m" for a sample model run that creates a figure while model is running, or
open and run "Sample_SimulationTaskList.m" to run model without visualization and write output files.
