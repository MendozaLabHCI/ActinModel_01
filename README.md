# ProtrusionModel
A MATLAB model of actin filaments and adhesions interacting with a cell membrane to create a protrusion.

ActinModel_01 was written using MATLAB 2022b. 
The function "PlotFilamentsAndMembrane.m" uses the Curve Fitting Toolbox (see notes after line 160 in PlotFilamentsAndMembrane.m where to comment outlines if you do not have access to Curve Fitting Toolbox).

Open and run "SimulateLamellipodiumModel_KRC01_NonFunction.m" for a sample model run that creates a figure while model is running, or
open and run "Sample_SimulationTaskList.m" to run model without visualization and have it write output files.
